# Credit Default Prediction in Indian Banks using ANN

This project aims to predict the probability of loan default using real-world data from Indian banks and CIBIL scores. The core model will be an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Data Pipeline (`data/`)
- Raw dataset downloaded from open sources (e.g., Kaggle).
- Data preprocessing scripts: cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling class imbalance (e.g., using SMOTE).

### 2. Model Pipeline (`src/models/`)
- `ann_model.py`: PyTorch implementation of the Artificial Neural Network.
- Architecture: Input layer matching feature count -> 2-3 Hidden Layers with ReLU activation and Dropout for regularization -> Output layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

### 3. Evaluation
- Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall (critical for capturing defaults), F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Business Logic: Simulating cost-benefit analysis based on the confusion matrix.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Split data into train/validation/test sets.
- Evaluate the ANN on the unseen test set to report final metrics.

### Manual Verification
- Review the ROC curve and confusion matrix.
- Ensure the selected operating threshold makes business sense (balancing False Positives and False Negatives).
