# Deep Learning for Managers — Project Workspace

Three deep learning projects (ANN + 2× LSTM/RNN) for the "Deep Learning for Managers" course, in the Indian business context.

## Directories

| Directory | What | When to read |
|---|---|---|
| `credit_default_prediction/` | ANN model predicting credit default risk (P1–P4) in Indian banks | Working on or presenting the credit risk project |
| `upi_fraud_detection/` | LSTM (RNN) detecting fraudulent UPI transaction sequences | Working on or presenting the UPI fraud project |
| `food_delivery_sentiment/` | LSTM (RNN) predicting Zomato restaurant rating category | Working on or presenting the food delivery project |
| `UPI_Fraud/` | Raw NPCI monthly UPI statistics source files (2021–2024) | Tracing NPCI data origin, re-running UPI data prep |
| `Food_Delivery/` | Raw Zomato CSV and JSON source files | Tracing Zomato data origin, re-running food delivery data prep |

## Files

| File | What | When to read |
|---|---|---|
| `Guidelines.md` | Project rules: report length (25–30 pages), citation policy, managerial insight requirement | Checking submission constraints or report structure |
| `Suggested Projects.md` | 14 project ideas with datasets, problem statements, and suggested techniques | Referencing topic rationale or choosing additional projects |
