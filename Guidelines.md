You may write an Introduction to the problem as a case study (optional).

E. Consider recent datasets (2018 onwards) from open sources or institute-subscribed databases.

F. Project must combine technical modelling with managerial implications.

G. Submit a 25-30 page report covering the business problem, data, methodology, results, and implications.
